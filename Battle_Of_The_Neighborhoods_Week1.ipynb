I live in Denver, and I thought it would be fun to step away from Toronto and New York City to work on a project a bit closer to home. I'll do this by downloading data from the city of Denver's website for each neighborhood in the city, calling the Foursquare API to get data on venues in each neighborhood, and finally, run a machine learning algorithm to help determine which neighborhood our brewery should go in."

I'll also be using venue data from the Foursquare API, which I'll clean, and eventually run through the K-Means machine learning algorithm (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) to determine where we should build a new brewery in Denver!"
